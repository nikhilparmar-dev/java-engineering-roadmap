# Java Engineering Roadmap 🚀

This repository documents my **step-by-step journey from Core Java to Java Backend Development**.  
It is **not random practice code** — it follows a structured roadmap designed for **placements and real-world backend roles**.

📌 **Focus:** Java, OOPs, DSA, JDBC, Spring Boot  
📌 **Goal:** Java Backend Developer  
📌 **Timeline:** Jan 2026 → Placement (2027–28)

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy

- One concept at a time
- One folder per topic
- Clean, readable, industry-style code
- Practice + mini-projects instead of theory dumping

This repo grows as my skills grow.

## 📂 Repository Structure (FROM → TO)

### 🔹 `01-basics`  → **FROM: Zero Java**
Java fundamentals and logic building.
- Variables, data types
- Conditions & loops
- Methods, input/output

👉 Purpose: Build syntax + logical thinking foundation

---

### 🔹 `02-oops`  → **FROM: Procedural → TO: Object-Oriented Thinking**
Core Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors, `this`
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Abstraction & Encapsulation
- Access modifiers, `static`

👉 Purpose: Stop writing everything in `main()` and think like an engineer

---

### 🔹 `03-dsa`  → **FROM: Basic Logic → TO: Interview-Level Thinking**
Data Structures & Algorithms using Java.
- Arrays & Strings
- Searching & Sorting
- Recursion & Binary Search
- Linked List, Stack, Queue (later)

👉 Purpose: Clear coding rounds & logic tests

---

### 🔹 `04-exceptions`  → **FROM: Crashing Programs → TO: Safe Code**
Exception handling in Java.
- try-catch-finally
- throw & throws
- Custom exceptions

👉 Purpose: Write robust, error-safe programs

---

### 🔹 `05-collections`  → **FROM: Arrays → TO: Real-World Data Handling**
Java Collection Framework.
- ArrayList, LinkedList
- HashMap, HashSet
- Iterator, Comparator

👉 Purpose: Industry-level data manipulation (very important for interviews)

---

### 🔹 `06-multithreading`  → **FROM: Single Task → TO: Parallel Execution**
Multithreading basics.
- Thread & Runnable
- Synchronization (basics)

👉 Purpose: Understand performance concepts (no overkill)

---

### 🔹 `07-jdbc`  → **FROM: Java Only → TO: Java + Database**
Java Database Connectivity.
- MySQL connection
- CRUD operations
- PreparedStatement

👉 Purpose: Backend entry point

---

### 🔹 `08-mini-projects`  → **FROM: Concepts → TO: Application**
Console and JDBC-based mini projects.
- Bank Account System
- Library Management System
- Student Record System

👉 Purpose: Prove practical understanding

---

### 🔹 `09-spring-boot`  → **FROM: Core Java → TO: Modern Backend**
Spring Boot & REST APIs.
- Dependency Injection
- REST controllers
- JPA + MySQL
- API testing with Postman

👉 Purpose: Job-ready backend skills

---

### 🔹 `10-mega-project`  → **FROM: Student → TO: Job-Ready Developer**
A complete backend project.
- E-commerce Backend / Blogging API
- Authentication & CRUD APIs

👉 Purpose: Resume + placement project

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

- Java
- MySQL
- JDBC
- Spring Boot
- Git & GitHub
- Postman

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- Daily coding practice
- Weekly revision
- Continuous refactoring & improvement

This repository is **actively maintained** as I progress through the roadmap.

---

## 🎯 End Goal

By the end of this roadmap, I aim to:
- Be placement-ready as a **Java Backend Developer**
- Build real, scalable backend applications
- Crack technical interviews with confidence
